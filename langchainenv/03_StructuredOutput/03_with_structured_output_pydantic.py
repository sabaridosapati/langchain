I recently visited Manali, a beautiful hill town in Himachal Pradesh.
The snow-capped mountains, pine forests, and rivers make it picture-perfect.
Solang Valley was the highlight — I tried paragliding for the first time and it was unforgettable.
Old Manali cafés are peaceful and great for remote work.
The only downside is the heavy traffic during peak season, and prices have gone up a lot recently.
